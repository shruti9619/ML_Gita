    "What is an iterator? Iterators are objects that can be iterated over like we do in a for loop. We can also say that an iterator is an object, which returns data, one element at a time. That is, they do not do any work until we explicitly ask for their next item. They work on a principle, which is known in computer science as lazy evaluation. Lazy evaluation is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is really needed. Due to the laziness of Python iterators, they are a great way to deal with infinity, i.e. iterables which can iterate for ever. You can hardly find Python programs that are not teaming with iterators."

Two cases are possible: o is either iterable or not. If o is not iterable, an exception will be raised, saying that the type of the object is not iterable. On the other hand, if o is iterable the call iter(o) will return an iterator, let us call it iterator_obj The for loop uses this iterator to iterate over the object o by using the next method. The for loop stops when next(iterator_obj) is exhausted, which means it returns a StopIteration exception."

    "A generator is a function which returns a generator object. This generator object can be seen like a function which produces a sequence of results instead of a single object. This sequence of values is produced by iterating over it, e.g. with a for loop. On the surface, generators in Python look like functions, but there is both a syntactic and a semantic difference. One distinguishing characteristic is the yield statements. The yield statement turns a functions into a generator. \n",
    "\n",
    "The values, on which can be iterated, are created by using the yield statement. The value created by the yield statement is the value following the yield keyword. The execution of the code stops when a yield statement is reached. The value behind the yield will be returned. The execution of the generator is interrupted now. As soon as \"next\" is called again on the generator object, the generator function will resume execution right after the yield statement in the code, where the last call is made. The execution will continue in the state in which the generator was left after the last yield. In other words, all the local variables still exist, because they are automatically saved between calls. This is a fundamental difference to functions: functions always start their execution at the beginning of the function body, regardless of where they had left in previous calls. They don't have any static or persistent values. There may be more than one yield statement in the code of a generator or the yield statement might be inside the body of a loop. If there is a return statement in the code of a generator, the execution will stop with a StopIteration exception error when this code is executed by the Python interpreter. The word \"generator\" is sometimes ambiguously used to mean both the generator function itself and the objects which are generated by a generator."

At the next call, the execution continues with the statement following the yield statement and the variables have the same values as they had in the previous call.\n",
