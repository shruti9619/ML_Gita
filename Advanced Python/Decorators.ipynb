    "The question I kept repeating while going through so many decorator guides and blogs was why do we need them. Basically decorators allow you to write modular code by making it possible to add or wrap functionality to/around existing functions without changing them.\n",
    "OK! but WHY do we need the decorator syntax? Why do we need nested functions to create a decorator? Why can't we just take an existing function, write another one with some extra functionality, and feed the first to the 2nd function to make it do something else?\n",
