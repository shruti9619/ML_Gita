    "- **Input and Output**:\n",
    "  - **RNN Language Model**: Takes a sequence of words and predicts the next word in the sequence.\n",
    "  - **Seq2Seq Model**: Takes a sequence of data and transforms it into another sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Architecture**:\n",
    "  - **RNN Language Model**: Typically uses a single RNN.\n",
    "  - **Seq2Seq Model**: Uses an encoder-decoder architecture with two RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applications**:\n",
    "  - **RNN Language Model**: Best suited for text generation and language modeling.\n",
    "  - **Seq2Seq Model**: Ideal for translation, summarization, and any task that requires sequence transformation.\n"

    "Why Seq2Seq -> It first become useful for language translation use-cases especially where the input and output length varied because in the existing architecture of RNN LMs the each input would generate an output and it would become a 1-1 count. Later it became possible to introduce attention mechanism and other advanced enhancements into this architecture while there was not much scope in RNN LMs."
